# Truffle Debug

This session focuses on setting up and testing around with the Truffle framework. It demonstrated the process of setting up a personal test blockchain with Ganache, configuring Truffle, deploying and testing a dummy contract, and debugging. The project includes multiple test cases to ensure that the smart contracts function as expected.
